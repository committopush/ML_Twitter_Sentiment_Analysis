# ML Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project explores various deep learning approaches to sentiment classification using the [dair-ai/emotion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion) dataset. The goal is to predict emotional tone (e.g., joy, sadness, anger) from tweets using different neural network architectures.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset consists of **20,000** labeled text samples split into training, validation, and test sets. Each entry includes:

- `text`: A string of user-generated content (similar to tweets)
- `label`: An emotion category:
  - `0` â€“ Sadness
  - `1` â€“ Joy
  - `2` â€“ Love
  - `3` â€“ Anger
  - `4` â€“ Fear
  - `5` â€“ Surprise

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented

### âœ… Baseline Models:
- **Simple RNN**: Single and stacked layers to process sequential text data
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Better captures long-term dependencies in sequences

### âœ… Advanced Models:
- **BERT (via TensorFlow Hub)**: Pre-trained transformer for contextual embedding and classification
- **Cohere Classification API**: Integration of Cohere's NLP models via API

## ðŸ”§ Key Concepts & Techniques

- Tokenization and padding of input sequences
- Text sequence length distribution analysis
- Model performance visualization (accuracy/loss over epochs)
- TensorFlow's Keras API for building and training models
- Comparative analysis of RNN, LSTM, and Transformer-based models
